TOPIC EXPLORATION: The Aristotle's Wheel Paradox
------------------------------------------------
This story is about paradox mentioned in the Greek work Mechanica, dubiously attributed to Aristotle. 
Consider a wheel consisting of two concentric circles of different diameters (that is a wheel within a wheel, 
or a wheel with external axe). Then if we roll this wheel between two straight lines (at the bottom of each of circle) , 
we can see than the distance developed by a point of the circle with greater diameter is apparently 
the same than the distance developed by a point on the small circle. 
So the wheel should travel the same distance regardless of whether it is rolled from left to right on 
the top straight line or on the bottom one. This seems to imply that the two circumferences 
of different sized circles are equal, which is impossible and this is the paradox.

We are going to explain the paradox visually coding the draw of graphics step by step.

PROJECT: The Galileo Inclined Plane
-----------------------------------
The goal of this project is to the develop a STEM learning unit for secondary school students mixing mathematics, 
science and coding.  With this work I want  to reproduce (taking data from real world) and analize 
with Wolfram Language the Galileo experiment wiht its inclined plane to deduce the physical law of falling bodies.


This three weeks project at WSS17 will be part of a bigger educational project, 
because I expect to start a serie of open learning materials for share and contribute to the Computer-Based Math , 
the Wolfram Demonstration Project and The Computational Thinking Initiative.
